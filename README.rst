============================

Have you ever wondered how to make your web images truly copy-protected? If so,

Pro's:
 - can't copy

Con's:
 - can screenshot
 - huge files
 - slow render


If you want to try it out, just clone and edit the source for the correct file.
This is not packages not does it have a cli, after all, who would want to use
